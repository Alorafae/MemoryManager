# MemoryManager
Memory manager for consistent memory times and performance, eg video game use.

# Built for Speed
This memory manager is specifically built to be as fast as possible and as such currently has no debugging or safety checks in it (yet). I do plan to add some debugging and simple safety checks that will be easily toggleable.

# Instrumented Profiler Use
This repo also makes use of and includes my Instrumented Profiler (https://github.com/Alorafae/InstrumentedProfiler)
